    <p>VELO LONGCHAMP is an association of cyclists for cyclists</p>
    <p>Initially, we have put forward the project of refurbishing the cycling ring of Longchamp as part of Parisian participative budget for 2020. This act was successful as it was selected and has resulted in funding being allocated (500 K€ pre-funded)! Our first mission is to follow this project so that up keeping is quickly acted upon and meets the needs of cyclists.</p>
    <p>Our vision is wider and could be described as follows: <strong>Protect and promote the Longchamp cycling ring so that each of us can cycle in the best conditions.</strong></p>
    <p>Thus, we are actively involved in various projects such as the development of cycling for young people or the support of disabled sport activities. As the area is protected from road traffic, the ring is particularly suitable for the training of athletes with disabilities.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the membership of hundreds of cyclists and various local sport clubs, we are proud to have amongst us all cyclist profiles and cycling activity without distinction of age, gender, level or even the type of bike! For example, we have practitioners who use tandem (some visually impaired or blind) or of recumbent bikes.</p>

  'presentation.why.message': `
    <p>The Longchamp cycling ring is one of those rare and precious places where you can ride at your own pace, being safe and protected from cars. In fact, according to Strava, it is by far the most used bike segment in France. It is thus an essential sport site!</p>
    <p>Like the Vincennes ring (Polygon), Longchamp cycling ring has become a real institution for sporty cyclists in Paris and nearby cities. Hundreds of amateur cyclists (or even professionals) train there daily as well as many hikers and runners who run in the opposite direction of those biking on the inside pavement.</p>
    <p>But as years pass, the conditions are worsening: damaged surfaces, road markings erased, falling or missing road signs, frequent conflicts of use with cars parked or leaving and accessing the hippodrome, lack of consultation with other users. It is time to redevelop the cycling ring so that we and the next generations can ride in perfectly safe and comfortable conditions.</p>

  'joinUs.faq.title': 'FAQ:',
  'joinUs.faq.questions': `
    <q>Who are you and why did you start an association?</q>
    <a>We are cyclists who regularly ride in Longchamp. We started an association to improve the sfety and conditions of the ring</a>
    <q>I don't have time to give to the association but I want to support it, should I join?</q>
    <a>Yes! Once a member, each of us decides the time we want to dedicate and can give to the association</a>
    <q>Are there any conditions to join?</q>
    <a>The only condition is to share our vision that the Longchamp cycling ring needs to be protected and promoted so that cyclists can practice the sport they love in the best conditions</a>
    <q>I cycle to work through Longchamp, can I join?</q>
    <a>Of course! We focus more on road cycling but we rely on our members representing all types of cycling, including commuters who represent a fair amount of use of Longchamp</a>
    <q>I rarely go to Longchamp, should I join?</q>
    <a>Yes! Your membership will help improve the conditions on the cycling ring for regular or occasionnal cyclists. An occasionnal cyclist has often better ideas than a cyclist who knows by heart all the dangers of Longchamp (damaged surface, tough conditions)</a>
    <q>I am already a member of another club, can I join?</q>
    <a>Yes and please get your club to join (so that even more cyclists are represented)</a>
